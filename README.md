In python, if statement is used to check whether the statement is true or false and run the code only when the statement is true. 
else statement contains the block of code it executes when the if condition statements are false.

### Importance of Flow Control in Python

It’s very much clear by now why we need python flow control. To decide the flow of your program and make it work exactly how you want it to be, we need flow control. And we use this in our day-to-day life also. Like, before crossing the road we check if we can safely cross the road or not. If not, we wait until safety is assured else we cross. Did you get the hang of it now?

We’re just making decisions and telling how the code should execute in certain situations, which statement to run before or after, etc. We’ve beautiful concise ways to implement flow control in python. Let’s discuss them.
